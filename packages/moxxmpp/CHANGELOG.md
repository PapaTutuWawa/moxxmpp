## 0.4.1
- Moved FAST from staging to xep_0484.dart

## 0.4.0

- **BREAKING**: Remove `lastResource` from `XmppConnection`'s `connect` method. Instead, set the `StreamManagementNegotiator`'s `resource` attribute instead. Since the resource can only really be restored by stream management, this is no issue.
- **BREAKING**: Changed order of parameters of `CryptographicHashManager.hashFromData`
- **BREAKING**: Removed support for XEP-0414, as the (supported) hash computations are already implemented by `CryptographicHashManager.hashFromData`.
- The `DiscoManager` now only handled entity capabilities if a `EntityCapabilityManager` is registered.
- The `EntityCapabilityManager` now verifies and validates its data before caching.
- **BREAKING**: Added the `resumed` parameter to `StreamNegotiationsDoneEvent`. Use this to check if the current stream is new or resumed instead of using the `ConnectionStateChangedEvent`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `DiscoManager.discoInfoCapHashQuery`.
- **BREAKING**: The entity argument of `DiscoManager.discoInfoQuery` and `DiscoManager.discoItemsQuery` are now `JID` instead of `String`.
- **BREAKING**: `PubSubManager` and `UserAvatarManager` now use `JID` instead of `String`.
- **BREAKING**: `XmppConnection.sendStanza` not only takes a `StanzaDetails` argument.
- Sent stanzas are now kept in a queue until sent.
- **BREAKING**: `MessageManager.sendMessage` does not use `MessageDetails` anymore. Instead, use `TypedMap`.
- `MessageManager` now allows registering callbacks for adding data whenever a message is sent.
- **BREAKING**: `MessageEvent` now makes use of `TypedMap`.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `PresenceReceivedEvent`. Use a manager registering handlers with priority greater than `[PresenceManager.presenceHandlerPriority]` instead.
- **BREAKING**: `ChatState.toString()` is now `ChatState.toName()`
- **BREAKING**: Overriding `BaseOmemoManager` is no longer required. `OmemoManager` now takes callback methods instead.
- Removed `ErrorResponseDiscoError` from the possible XEP-0030 errors.
- **BREAKING**: Removed "Extensible File Thumbnails" (The `Thumbnail` type).
- *BREAKING*: Rename `UserAvatarManager`'s `getUserAvatar` to `getUserAvatarData`. It now also requires the id of the avatar to fetch
- *BREAKING*: `UserAvatarManager`'s `getAvatarId` with `getLatestMetadata`.
- The `PubSubManager` now supports PubSub's `max_items` in `getItems`.
- *BREAKING*: `vCardManager`'s `VCardAvatarUpdatedEvent` no longer automatically requests the newest VCard avatar.
- *BREAKING*: `XmppConnection` now tries to ensure that incoming data is processed in-order. The only exception are awaited stanzas as they are allowed to bypass the queue.
- *BREAKING*: If a stanza handler causes an exception, the handler is simply skipped while processing.
- Add better logging around what stanza handler is running and if they end processing early.

## 0.3.1

- Fix some issues with running moxxmpp as a component

## 0.3.0

- **BREAKING**: Removed `connectAwaitable` and merged it with `connect`.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `allowPlainAuth` from `ConnectionSettings`. If you don't want to use SASL PLAIN, don't register the negotiator. If you want to only conditionally use SASL PLAIN, extend the `SaslPlainNegotiator` and override its `matchesFeature` method to only call the super method when SASL PLAIN should be used.
- **BREAKING**: The user avatar's `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` no longer subscribe to the `:data` PubSub nodes
- Renamed `ResourceBindingSuccessEvent` to `ResourceBoundEvent`
- **BREAKING**: Removed `isFeatureSupported` from the manager attributes. The managers now all have a method `isFeatureSupported` that works the same
- The `PresenceManager` is now optional
- **BREAKING**: Removed `setConnectionSettings` and `getConnectionSettings`. Just directly acces the `connectionSettings` field.
- Implement XEP-0114 for implementing components
- **BREAKING**: Remove `useDirectTLS` from `ConnectionSettings`
